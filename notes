Code review:

After a developer has finished working on an issue, dev asks the following Qs:

1. Are there any obvious errors in the code? 
2. Are all cases fully implemented?
3. are the new autom. tests sufficient for the new code?
4. Any rewriting required?
5. Does the new code fit to existing guidelines? 

Should integrate with a team's existing processes. 

Agile teams: work is decentralized, none know a specific line of code.
helps facilitate knowledge acrosss the code base and across the team. 

Flexibility: ability to take work off the backlog 
and able to go through new work because none is the critical path. 

Better estimations. new features: good feeback and estimations. share of knowledge. 
exposed to complex code. it leads to multiple, informed inputs which when used for 
final estimate always makes that estimate stronger and reliable. 

reviews enable time off. for vacation etc...

it mentors newer engineers. 

share the load. two reviews of any code. two inputs.

review before merging. 

 use peer pressure to your adv.
